    "text": "Virtual Machine (VM)\nA virtual machine is a way to run another computer inside your computer you are using. If you are reading this on a Windows computer then that is called the host machine and the other computer you put inside your computer is called a hypervisor. Think of your main computer as a big box, and the VM is a smaller box inside the big box.\nThe hypervisor is isolated from your main computer, you can run any operating system on it, have multiple versions of it and if something goes bad, you can restart a new one. One thing to remember when you install a VM is that it thinks it is the only computer around, it has no idea about being inside a Windows or Apple computer.\nThe VM I suggest for beginners is VirualBox, Link here . This is usually what everyone suggests anyway as their first VM to learn on. On Youtube has videos on how to install VirtualBox, so there is no need to go over it here.\n\nIf you want to use another VM and are using an Apple computer then VMware is one I really like using. There are many products VMware offers but the one you want to select is the VM Fusion for personal use. The personal use you will need to make an account to get the access key which means you get to use it for free. The Link here.\n\nInstalling VMware is pretty straightforward, but in either VM, you can allow the computer to use default settings for disk space as it can be changed later in the settings. You can delete a VM and start again."

Much of the Free Open Source Software community is on this platform and is a great place to search for programming materials.\nThe Link is here for your free account. Note, there is also GitLab which requires a different username and password but works similarly.\n\nYou can host your own blog on GitHub or place your code on GitHub and then have Netlify etc. host your blog or whatever program you make. It is worthwhile getting used to GitHub as you will likely search for cyber security software and resources from here. You can find people to follow and see what projects they are working on, getting involved is always appreciated.\n\nGitHub is the website you put your code and share it"

Some of the options are:\n\nVS Code, has many extensions and themes\nSublime text editor\nAtom\nNotepad++\n\nFor cyber security / hacking inside your VM, then it is best to stick with bare bones editors. Bare bones editors are ones that come installed with Linux like nano and Vim, these are light on the demnds of the computer.\nInside your terminal, type nano newfile.txt which will open nano and then you start typing in the text file, press Cmd + S, and then Cmd + X to exit (instructions on bottom of terminal). Note: this will open and create ‘newfile.txt’ whereever your present working directory is."

Note: folder and directory is being used interchangeably. All of these commands are typed in the terminal.\n\npwd means present working directory, this shows what files and folders are inside the folder directory you are at. If you have a file “desk.png”, and you are located at the desktop directory, you will see “desk.png” listed.\nls means list the things in the pwd\ncd means change directory, if you are in the home directory but want to go to the Download folder, you type cd Download/.\nsudo apt install <package> sudo means super user do, which is the command to run things as root (as admin) which requires a password (you will not see your password being typed, no ’*’ shown). This command installs the package you name.\nsudo apt update run this command to update all software packages on your linux VM or OS, you should get in a habit of running this every time you start the machine.\nsudo apt upgrade run this command for similar reason above, you want to ensure you stay uup to date on Linux packages.\nman <command> man means manual, it is the instructions for how to use a command, if you want to know more about ‘pwd’ you type man pwd and you will get a guide on how it works.\n<program> -h or --help is how to get help on how to use a program function. Example hashcat , type hashcat -h\ncd ~ this command takes you to your home directory, it will list Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc. Wherever you are in the file system, this command will take you home (yep, a pun).\n\nHere is a tip, you often just need to type part of the word for a directory or file and hit tab for it to autocomplete. If autocomplete is not working then it is an indication you are in the wrong directory or the path is wrong.\n\nWe covered:\n\nVirtual Machines\nKali Linux\nGitHub\nCode Editor\nLinux Crash Course\n\nThis hopefully this was helpful to you and gets you ready for all the learning ahead."

The technology changes but some of the core concepts of cyber security remain the same overtime.\nPlenty of websites and YouTube videos on Cyber Security exist but none of them are talking to me, 99% of all the content is aimed at cisgender men. This blog is aimed at everyone else, there will be no “dudes”, “guys”, “bros”, etc in my blog.\nThis blog will have free information and will mix content from various resources that I have used and/ or learned from.

If you have ever wondered “how does this work?”, “What if I do this?” and see if it breaks, then this is the path.\nThe mindset, the way you think about things will be altered as you learn cyber security, as you will need to start thinking like a malicious hacker. Doing the Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions you will force you to learn quickly a new Linux command, software program or vulnerability. These are fast (and free) way to learn the mindset and skills.\nJust about every professional Cyber Security / Hacker that I have watched or listned to (on podcasts and YouTube) has mentioned that doing CTFs is a surefire way to learn and get experience (not really ‘real world’ experience) but experience finding your way into a system."

Good thing about VMs are that they are free to download and use. VirtualBox is the most common one used and runs on all computers.\nYou will need to know Linux Operating System (OS) and commands. Most popular cyber security Linux OS is Kali Linux and Parrot OS. These operating systems have many tools built in for cyber security.\nLearn how to search. You may think “I already know how to use Google”, but there is a method called Google Dorks (Google dorking). Let us search for a news story from BBC or whatever, you remember that they had a story dealing with a specific topic, for example rise in ocean acidification. You will dork your query as such in the url: bbc: ocean acidification . People would also do Reddit as part of their dorking.\nLearn a programming language. Having knowledge of Python has helped me understand some of the code in exploits and getting through some learning module challenges. Find a language you like, that you understand, as this skill helps you in technology careers but also outside in daily life.\nEvery cyber security professional / hacker knows failure, and so will you. YOU WILL FAIL a lot, accept it, and most importantly, is that it is the basis for learning. Hacking is failing your way to success, you will fail multiple times iterating over characters in a password you are trying to crack. You will likely succeed if you try, search for a solution, ask for help and take break between attempts.\n\nIn my view, cyber security is like math, it is hard and many people do not want anything to do with it, yet it is all around you. When you finally get the answer to a problem it feels great.\n\nCyber Security / Ethical Hacking is exciting and fun to learn, challenging to do and practice. Many people in the cyber security community share what they know and learn, so help is out there."

What is this switch?\n\nlook at OS DETECTION, -O enable OS detection\n\nQuestion: Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?\n\nlook at SERVICE/VERSION DETECTION, -sV probe open ports to see service version\n\nQuestion: The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?\n\nlook at OUTPUT, -v increase verbosity\n\nQuestion: Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?\n\n-vv\n\nQuestion: We should always save the output of our scans – this means that we only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection), and gives us a reference to use when writing reports for clients. What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?\n\nOUTPUT, -oA output in 3 major formats at once\n\nQuestion: What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a “normal” format?\n\nOUTPUT, -oN output scan in normal format\n\nQuestion: A very useful output format: how would you save results in a “grepable” format?\n\n-oG\n\nQuestion: This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.\n\n-A\n\nQuestion: Nmap offers five levels of “timing” template. These are essentially used to increase the speed your scan runs at. Be careful though: higher speeds are noisier, and can incur errors! How would you set the timing template to level 5?\n\n-T5 timing template\n\nQuestion: We can also choose which port(s) to scan. How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?\n\nlook at PORT SPECIFICATION, -p, -p 80\n\nQuestion: How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?\n\n-p 1000-1500\n\nQuestion: How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?\n\n-p- instead of a number after the p\n\nQuestion: How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library?\n\n-script\n\nQuestion: How would you activate all of the scripts in the “vuln” category?\n\n-script=vuln"

    "text": "Task 2\nNFS stands for “Network File System” and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. With NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. NFS is a distributed file system protocol and is not encrypted, no user authentication by default.\n\nNFS mounts all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.\n\nHow it works:\n\nclient will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device\nThe mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.\nThe server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested\nIt will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.\n\nIf someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:\n\nfile handle\nname of file to be accessed\nuser ID\nuser’s group ID\n\nThese parameters are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions (read and write of files).\nUsing the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.\n\nA computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers.\nNFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.\n\nQuestion: What does NFS stand for?\n\nnetwork file system\n\nQuestion: What process allows an NFS client to interact with a remote directory as though it was a physical device?\n\nhint: What does your Operating System do to access a physical drive?\nmounting\n\nQuestion: What does NFS use to represent files and directories on the server?\n\nfile handle\n\nQuestion: What protocol does NFS use to communicate between the server and client?\n\nRPC\n\nQuestion: What two pieces of user data does the NFS server take as parameters for controlling user permissions? Format: parameter 1 / parameter 2\n\nuser id / group id\n\nQuestion: Can a Windows NFS server share files with a Linux client? (Y/N)\n\nyes\n\nQuestion: Can a Linux NFS server share files with a MacOS client? (Y/N)\n\nyes\n\nQuestion: What is the latest version of NFS? [released in 2016, but is still up to date as of 2020] This will require external research.\n\n4.2"

In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP (send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail).\n\nSMTP functions:\n\nverifies who is sending emails through SMTP server\nsend outgoing mail\nif mail can’t be delivered, then return message to sender\n\nPOP, or “Post Office Protocol” and IMAP, “Internet Message Access Protocol” are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server.\n\nPOP’s more simplistic approach of downloading the inbox from the mail server, to the client.\nIMAP will synchronise the current inbox, with new mail on the server, downloading anything new.\n\nThis means that changes to the inbox made on one computer, over IMAP, will persist if you then synchronise the inbox from another computer.\nHow SMTP works:\n\nuser will supply the email (a letter) and a service (the postal delivery service)\nrole of the SMTP server in this service, is to act as the sorting office\nthe email (letter) is picked up and sent to this server, which then directs it to the recipient\n\n\nthe mail user agent (your email client or external program) connects to SMTP server, starts a SMTP handshake, runs on port 25, is validated and SMTP session starts\nsending mail process, client submits [the sender & recipient’s email address] + [email body] + [attachments] to server\nSMTP server checks if domain name of recipient & sender is the same\nSMTP server of sender will make a connection to recipient’s SMTP server before sending email. If not accessible then the email is put into a queue\nrecipient’s SMTP server will verify the incoming email, checking if domain & user name have been recognized, then server will forward the email to POP/IMAP\nrecipient will get email in inbox\n\nQuestion: What does SMTP stand for?\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol\n\nQuestion: What does SMTP handle the sending of? (answer in plural)\n\nemails\n\nQuestions: What is the first step in the SMTP process?\n\nSMTP handshake\n\nQuestion: What is the default SMTP port?\n\n25\n\nQuestion: Where does the SMTP server send the email if the recipient’s server is not available?\n\nSMTP queue\n\nQuestion: On what server does the Email ultimately end up on?\n\nPOP/IMAP\n\nQuestion: Can a Linux machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)\n\ny\n\nQuestion: Can a Windows machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)\n\ny"

Need to fingerprint the server to make our targeting as precise as possible.\n\nusing ‘smtp_version’ module of a Metasploit, which will scan a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail server\nusing module ‘smtp_enum’ that will enumerate users, uses a host or range to scan plus a wordlist that has usernames\nMetasploit is installed in Kali and Parrot OS\n\nSMTP service has 2 internal commands that allow the enumeration of users:\n\nVRFY which confirms the names of valid users\nEXPNwhich reveals the address of user’s aliases & lists of email commands\n\nEnumeration run nmap scan.\nQuestion: First, lets run a port scan against the target machine, same as last time. What port is SMTP running on?\n\n25\n\nQuestion: Start Metasploit. What command do we use to do this?\n\nmsfconsole\n\nQuestion: Let’s search for the module “smtp_version”, what’s it’s full module name?\n\nauxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version\n\nQuestion: Great, now- select the module and list the options. How do we do this?\n\nuse 0 > options\n\nQuestion: Have a look through the options, does everything seem correct? What is the option we need to set?\n\nRHOSTS\nset RHOSTS IP\n\nQuestion: Set that to the correct value for your target machine. Then run the exploit. What’s the system mail name?\n\nafter setting the RHOSTS IP address > type run\npolosmtp.home\n\nQuestion: What Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is running the SMTP server? This will require some external research.\n\nhint: If I want to send a letter to my friend I have to **** it.\nPostfix\n\nQuestion: We’ve now got a good amount of information on the target system to move onto the next stage. Let’s search for the module “smtp_enum”, what’s it’s full module name?\n\nauxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum\n\nWe’re going to be using the “top-usernames-shortlist.txt” wordlist from the Usernames subsection of seclists (/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames if you have it installed).\nSeclists is an amazing collection of wordlists. If you’re running Kali or Parrot you can install seclists with: “sudo apt install seclists”.\nQuestion: What option do we need to set to the wordlist’s path?\n\nuser_file\nset USER_FILE /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt\n[AttackBox] inside the msfconsole: set USER_FILE ~/Tools/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt\n\nQuestion: Once we’ve set this option, what is the other essential paramater we need to set?\n\nRHOSTS\nset THREADS 16\n\nNow, run the exploit, this may take a few minutes, so grab a cup of tea, coffee, water.\nQuestion: Okay! Now that’s finished, what username is returned?\n\n[did not get scan to work, answer is from walkthrough] administrator"

You can, as we have in previous tasks, attempt to brute-force default account passwords if you really don’t have any other information; however, in most CTF scenarios, this is unlikely to be the avenue you’re meant to pursue.\nThis task assumes you have found the credentials “root:password” when enumerating the subdomain web server, trying to login SSH and try against MySQL.\n\ninstall MySQL if not already installed: sudo apt install default-mysql-client\nusing Metasploit for this\n\nQuestion: As always, let’s start out with a port scan, so we know what port the service we’re trying to attack is running on. What port is MySQL using?\n\n3306\n\nGood, now we have to set of credentials. Let’s double check that by manually connecting to the MySQL server. We can do this using the command “mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p”.\nOkay, we know that our login credentials work. Lets quit out of this session with “exit” and launch up Metasploit.\n\nMetasploit: ‘mysql_sql’ module > info 0\npassword/rhosts/username\n\nQuestion: Run the exploit.
