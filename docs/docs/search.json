    "text": "Virtual Machine (VM)\nA virtual machine is a way to run another computer inside your computer you are using. If you are reading this on a Windows computer then that is called the host machine and the other computer you put inside your computer is called a hypervisor. Think of your main computer as a big box, and the VM is a smaller box inside the big box.\nThe hypervisor is isolated from your main computer, you can run any operating system on it, have multiple versions of it and if something goes bad, you can restart a new one. One thing to remember when you install a VM is that it thinks it is the only computer around, it has no idea about being inside a Windows or Apple computer.\nThe VM I suggest for beginners is VirualBox, Link here . This is usually what everyone suggests anyway as their first VM to learn on. On Youtube has videos on how to install VirtualBox, so there is no need to go over it here.\n\nIf you want to use another VM and are using an Apple computer then VMware is one I really like using. There are many products VMware offers but the one you want to select is the VM Fusion for personal use. The personal use you will need to make an account to get the access key which means you get to use it for free. The Link here.\n\nInstalling VMware is pretty straightforward, but in either VM, you can allow the computer to use default settings for disk space as it can be changed later in the settings. You can delete a VM and start again."

Name the VM after the OS it is. Start up the machine (will take a few minutes to boot up), enter your username and password.

Much of the Free Open Source Software community is on this platform and is a great place to search for programming materials.\nThe Link is here for your free account. Note, there is also GitLab which requires a different username and password but works similarly.\n\nYou can host your own blog on GitHub or place your code on GitHub and then have Netlify etc. host your blog or whatever program you make. It is worthwhile getting used to GitHub as you will likely search for cyber security software and resources from here. You can find people to follow and see what projects they are working on, getting involved is always appreciated.\n\nGitHub is the website you put your code and share it"

Some of the options are:\n\nVS Code, has many extensions and themes\nSublime text editor\nAtom\nNotepad++\n\nFor cyber security / hacking inside your VM, then it is best to stick with bare bones editors. Bare bones editors are ones that come installed with Linux like nano and Vim, these are light on the demnds of the computer.\nInside your terminal, type nano newfile.txt which will open nano and then you start typing in the text file, press Cmd + S, and then Cmd + X to exit (instructions on bottom of terminal). Note: this will open and create ‘newfile.txt’ whereever your present working directory is."

This information applies to Apple users as Apple is based off of Unix, so in a Mac computer with the terminal you can apply most of Linux commands.\nHere is a crash course, but you will greatly benefit from further learning. Note: folder and directory is being used interchangeably. All of these commands are typed in the terminal.\n\npwd means present working directory, this shows what files and folders are inside the folder directory you are at. If you have a file “desk.png”, and you are located at the desktop directory, you will see “desk.png” listed.\nls means list the things in the pwd\ncd means change directory, if you are in the home directory but want to go to the Download folder, you type cd Download/.\nsudo apt install <package> sudo means super user do, which is the command to run things as root (as admin) which requires a password (you will not see your password being typed, no ’*’ shown). This command installs the package you name.\nsudo apt update run this command to update all software packages on your linux VM or OS, you should get in a habit of running this every time you start the machine.\nsudo apt upgrade run this command for similar reason above, you want to ensure you stay uup to date on Linux packages.\nman <command> man means manual, it is the instructions for how to use a command, if you want to know more about ‘pwd’ you type man pwd and you will get a guide on how it works.\n<program> -h or --help is how to get help on how to use a program function. Example hashcat , type hashcat -h\ncd ~ this command takes you to your home directory, it will list Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc. Wherever you are in the file system, this command will take you home (yep, a pun).\n\nHere is a tip, you often just need to type part of the word for a directory or file and hit tab for it to autocomplete. If autocomplete is not working then it is an indication you are in the wrong directory or the path is wrong.\n\nWe covered:\n\nVirtual Machines\nKali Linux\nGitHub\nCode Editor\nLinux Crash Course\n\nThis hopefully this was helpful to you and gets you ready for all the learning ahead."

If you have ever wondered “how does this work?”, “What if I do this?” and see if it breaks, then this is the path.\nThe mindset, the way you think about things will be altered as you learn cyber security, as you will need to start thinking like a malicious hacker. Doing the Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions you will force you to learn quickly a new Linux command, software program or vulnerability. These are fast (and free) way to learn the mindset and skills.\nJust about every professional Cyber Security / Hacker that I have watched or listned to (on podcasts and YouTube) has mentioned that doing CTFs is a surefire way to learn and get experience (not really ‘real world’ experience) but experience finding your way into a system."

Good thing about VMs are that they are free to download and use. VirtualBox is the most common one used and runs on all computers.\nYou will need to know Linux Operating System (OS) and commands. Most popular cyber security Linux OS is Kali Linux and Parrot OS. These operating systems have many tools built in for cyber security.\nLearn how to search. You may think “I already know how to use Google”, but there is a method called Google Dorks (Google dorking). Let us search for a news story from BBC or whatever, you remember that they had a story dealing with a specific topic, for example rise in ocean acidification. You will dork your query as such in the url: bbc: ocean acidification . People would also do Reddit as part of their dorking.\nLearn a programming language. Having knowledge of Python has helped me understand some of the code in exploits and getting through some learning module challenges. Find a language you like, that you understand, as this skill helps you in technology careers but also outside in daily life.\nEvery cyber security professional / hacker knows failure, and so will you. YOU WILL FAIL a lot, accept it, and most importantly, is that it is the basis for learning. Hacking is failing your way to success, you will fail multiple times iterating over characters in a password you are trying to crack. You will likely succeed if you try, search for a solution, ask for help and take break between attempts.\n\nIn my view, cyber security is like math, it is hard and many people do not want anything to do with it, yet it is all around you.

    "text": "Task 4.1\nThe most common hash cracking tools are Hashcat and John the Ripper.\nModes of cracking:\n\nwordlist = a long list of common words like a dictionary for passwords\nincremental mode = trying all possible character combinations as passwords (powerful but longer run time, especially if password is long)\nrule mode = uses wodlist mode with a character/ string pattern\n\nRule based bruteforce attacks:\n\ngenerating a custom wordlist and using the standard wordlist mode iwth it\nusing a common wordlist with a custom rules. This saves time iterating over thousands of lines of possible passwords. Using a custom wordlist can be applied for multiple cracking uses.\n\n\nI changed the order of instructions from the room as this process makes more sense to install SecList then talk about John the Ripper.\n\nWe are instructed to install a SecList wordlist from GitHub. Then use the top 10,000 password list.\n\nif on Kali linux, install sudo apt -y install seclists\nthe path for passwords: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt\n\nJohn the Ripper has syntax for using a wordlist with rules.\n\nlocate where John the Ripper is on your machine, for me it is /usr/share/john\nsudo touch john-local.conf\n\ninsert:\n[List.Rules:THM01]\n$[0-9]$[0-9]\n\nthere is a file john.conf and need to run this file, john john.conf then quit\n\nNow the hash we need to crack.\n\nhash: 2d5c517a4f7a14dcb38329d228a7d18a3b78ce83\nhash type: SHA1\n\nPut the hash into a text file, specify the hash type, the wordlist and our rule name.\n\ni named my file riphash.txt\njohn riphash.txt --format=raw-sha1 --wordlist=/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt --rules=THM01\n\nWow, that was SUPER fast to crack such a simple password."

    "text": "Welcome to my hacking newb blog!\nThis blog is about sharing all of the Cyber Security / Ethical Hacking knowledge I learn with whomever reads this. My goal is to make this information accessible, many parts in one.\nEverything is beginner friendly as I am also learning this huge topic and sharing what I learn.\nWhy start a blog?\nTo help others learn Cyber Security in an ever Internet of Things world, anything connected to the internet is hackable. By learning some cyber security you help protect yourself from many vulnerabilities. Those who need to know cyber security the most have barriers to accessing this information or have no idea where to start.\nI am here to help and be part of the Free Open Source Software (FOSS) community.\nWhy ‘hacker newb’ ?\nWhenever someone is new to a technology stack, they are called or referred to as a “newb” and that is what I am and who my target audience is."
