Cyber Security terms and definitions.

<img width='800' src="banner.png">

## Asset

Assets are anything that a cyber security strategy should protect. Assets are physical and digital, software and hardware along with the data pertaining to them.

## Access Control (AC)

Any website or web application that restricts access to only users and their data on that website or app. 

## Authentication

Making sure only verified users have access to data on a website or app. Authentication is proving the user is who they claim to be. Authentication is done by username, passwords, and 2 Factor Authentication (2FA).


## Antivirus

A software used for detecting and removing a malicious software from the machine that the antivirus is installed on.

To see if a program or file is malicious you can upload it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
to analyze it and rate out of 100 to check how dangerous it is. Once you upload a file this information is dispersed to all the antivirus software companies/vendors.

## Bug

The term 'bug' in computer history is credited to computer programmer [Grace Hopper in 1947](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334663).

It simply means there is an error in the software code, which will crash your program or cause there to be a vulnerability. Anyone who works with software knows bugs, they are part of life. 


## Botnet 

A collection of computers which have been infected by a malicious software in order to run commands given to them by the attacker from the Command and Control Centre.


## <span style="color:#66b3ff"> Blue Team </span>

A team of cyber security professionals with a shared 
goal to defend and protect an organization from Cyber Attacks. This teams is part of the Security Operations Center (SOC) who are actively watching for attacks.


## Black Hat 

A black hat hacker is one who _breaks the law_ and violates security policies for personal profit (and fame).
Hacking into a company's system without <span style="text-decoration:underline">explicit authorization</span> is black hat activity. 

If you want to see how many researchers investigate and explore the world of black hat hackers, there is a YouTube channel, [link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackHatOfficialYT).


## Critical Infrastructure

Any asset that is vital to the organization and is the main focus for security teams strategies in defense. 


## Cyber Atack

An attempt to compromise/ bypass a protected system. This can range from simple to large scale attacks.


## Cryptography

All the mathematical processes performed on data to provide privacy, authentication, integrity and security.
The world of hacking deals with hashes.

For an example and useful tool, you can generate your own [md5hash](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/) and then later use it for learning hashcat and other hashing tools.

<img src="md5hash.png">

The string 'cryptography' has the long hash, if you were to change 1 little character or digit the whole hash will be different.


## CVE

`Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures` (CVE) is a term you will absolutely see and hear. A database of publicly disclosed information security issues. A CVE number uniquely identifies one vulnerability from the list.

All CVEs start with the year, then a dash, followed by the number of vulnerabilities found. The link here is for a 2014 CVE, TimThumb and WordThumb which allowed Remote Code Execution (RCE),
[NIST CVE database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4663).


## Data breach

The unwanted disclosure or access to confidential information.


## Data theft

The intentional act of stealing data. Stealing daya can be done through physical means or a data leak resulting for a code vulnerability.


## <span style="color:#ff4d4d"> DDOS </span>

This term is common to hear. Distributed Denial of Service.
An attack during which the access of a certain system is blocked usually due to purposely ran flooding attacks and connection resource demand.

- the website is unreachable, it is broken


## Digital Forensics 

Digital forensics is a branch of cyber security that is involved after a attack has happened. Digital forensics is involved in recovery, investigation, examination and analysis of digital devices (along with physical ones). 


## DLP 

Data Loss Prevention is a collection of security strategies used to prevent the occurrence of data loss and data leakage.


## Encoding

Taking plain text and converting it to ciphertext, unreadable and ununderstandble text. 

- If you did the hash example then you understand this.


## Encyrption key

Encryption Key is a random string of bits created for scrambling and unscrambling data. They are designed with intention to be unpredictable and unique.


## Firewall 

A software security tool used for filtering web traffic. 
The firewall is controlled by a set of rules which traffic will 
be let through and which is blocked. 

- Host based firewall
- Network based firewall



## <span style="color:#ffcc00"> Honeypot </span>

An intentional vulnerable system used from trapping
Black Hat hackers. It is a false system made as a decoy for the 
hacker to fall for. When an attacker falls for the honeypot
it alerts security experts and researchers of the potential threat. 


## IDS

Intrusion Detection System is a monitoring system that
detects suspicious activities and generates alerts when they are 
detected.


## IPS

Intrusion Prevention System is a security tool to constantly monitor
the network for malicious activity, takes actions to prevent and block activities.


## <span style="color:#ff4d4d"> Malware </span>

Malicious software or Malware is code written with an intent to cause harm and violate the security of a system. 
There are many types of Malware: 

- RATs  _remote access trojan_
- Keyloggers
- Trojans
- Rootkits
- Backdoors
- Adwares.


## Packet Sniffing 

This is when you use software like **Wireshark** and **Burpsuite** to
collect and capture internet packets off of a data network communication. 

You are looking at all the HTTPS requests back and forth from your system or network to the endpoint, to see if anyone is sending little network packets with malicious code. This is used for defense and for offense purposes. 



## Patch

This is a software update to repair a existing software bug/ flaw in the code or system. It is important to keep up to date on your software for devices. 



## Phishing 

Phishing is the most common cyber attack, and is part of <span style="color:#ffff66"> Social Engineering </span> strategies for attacks. 

The attack is when the target gives their <span style="text-decoration:overline; color:#ffff66"> confidential information 
</span>  (username and password) to an email, person on the phone, social media or an acquaintance without knowing it.



## Pen Testing 

<img src="pentest.png">

Penetration Tester is part of the security Blue Team or an individual
who checks and scans for any bugs and vulnerabilities using various software tools. After a pentest, a report is made which details any bugs and vulnerabilities that were found.


## Risk Management

Internet Technology risk management is the application of risk management methods to manage IT threats. IT risk management involves procedures, policies, and tools to identify and assess potential threats and vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure


## <span style="color:#ff6666"> Red Team </span>

This team is _opposing_ the Blue Team. This team often gets more 
attention and hype due to its nature of "break stuff and report on it" job.

A group of cybersecurity experts that perform offensive security exercises on the company to test its security.

The goal of this is to act as an attacker and find out as many potential vulnerabilities which can compromise the system/assets of an organization.

- act like a malicious hacker and get paid

This team can also work for a Bug Bounty program, where a company pays Red Teams to find vulnerabilities and get paid for their work.



## Sandboxing

The act of isolating a system or an application in order to perform testing.
If you installed a Virtual Machine then you have a sandbox environment.


## <span style="color:#ffff66"> Social Engineering </span> 

Social Engineering is a field on its own, it is how many cyber attacks are performed and it does not get much attention in context of other cyber security topics.

Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions.

Example: _Call your bank, provide incorrect information and see if you are able to bypass your security question. Your birthday is often the security question which a friend or colleague would know._ 

- The objective is to see what cyber security safeguards can be bypassed with publically available information



## Spam 

The folder in your email with messages or 
your phone being sent text messages that were not wanted.

These typically have spelling errors, general in scope but with ChatGPT and such Artificial Intelligence these spam emails and texts are getting better with English grammar making it easier for victims to fall for these attacks.



## VPN 

Virtual Private Network is a communication link between systems which is encrypted in order to provide a more secure and private communication.

Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can see what websites you go to, overall web traffic, but a VPN makes a tunnel in which your home internet IP address changes and the VPN see what website you visit. Many VPN providers do not keep logs and delete them daily, which makes your web traffic more secure. When using a VPN it is a secure way to use the internet. 


## Vulnerability 

Vulnerability Is a flaw in code or system that weakens the overall security of that system.

vulnerability examples:

- using an older web browser
- not updating your phone software
- not updating your computer operating software
- visiting HTTP websites (not encrypted, not safe)
- allowing the browser to store your passwords



## <span style="color:#ffffff"> White Hat </span> 

A white hat hacker or ethical hacker is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks.

The line between Black Hat and White Hat is Grey Hat, there is some subjectivity in the details of what a White Hat versus a Grey Hat does.
Either way the White Hat reports vulnerabilities and likely does 
the Bug Bounty programs.
