How to get software tools from GitHub on your Linux machine.

## GitHub 

For getting software tools and code from GitHub does not require signing into the website. Here are the instruction on how to a repository package onto your Linux VM. 

This example will be getting `theHarvester` repo from ParrotSec.
Inside your Linux VM, launch the firefox browser, Google dork for theHarvester.

Inside your VM open the terminal, navigate to your desktop (or whever you want to store this repository) `cd Desktop/`.

Then type `git clone` + paste in the HTTPS link. It should have '.git' at the end. Hit enter. Hit `ls` to see the directory.

Next is to install the required software, instruction are commonly placed on the README file of the repository. We are told to run the command:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` which installs packages.

Type `python3 theHarvester.py`

The program will quit because no argument parameter were provided. 
Type `python3 theHarvester.py --help` to get the instructions on how to use this program.


to run a search: 

- `python3 theHarvester.py -d <website> -b all`
- fill in `<website>` with whatever your target is
- the `-b all` means search using all the domains 

For a smaller scan: 

- `python3 theHarvester.py -d <website> -l 300  -b anubis` 
- this limits scans to 300 and uses just anubis


To use API keys for searching:

- inside the terminal: `nano /etc/theHarvester/api-keys.yaml`
- opens a text file where you paste in your keys and the program will utilize the API keys 
  

theHarvester is known to be a hit and miss for returning results, some days it will work great. The scan takes a few minutes, so you can get a coffee and come back.
