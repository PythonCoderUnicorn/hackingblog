Crack the Hash room. 
This blog post is how to get to the answer without showing the answer. 
I found the answer, and you will learn how to as well.

The TryHackMe room link [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/crackthehash). This room is for beginners with some familiarity with how hashes work.
Answer the questions by cracking the hashes.




## Methodology

- go to [Hash Analyzer](https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/) paste in the hash to know what hash type
- look at hashcat manual: [https://manpages.org/hashcat]()
- [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes]()
- paste hash in a text file 5 times (otherwise hashcat throws an error). I delete previous 5 hashes so i don't have to add `--potfile-disable`
- hashcat syntax: `hashcat <options> <hashes> <mask>`
- use hashcat `hashcat -m0 -a0 -o hashed.txt hash.txt /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt`. The `-o` is for output a file, then pass in the file with the hashes you want cracked. At the end is the location of the wordlist.

## Hash Level 1.1

- hash: `48bb6e862e54f2a795ffc4e541caed4d`
- hash analyzer: md5 
- hash type: `-m0` 


## Hahs Level 1.2

- hash: `CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97`
- hash analyzer: sha1 
- hash type: `-m100`


## Hash Level 1.3

- hash: `1C8BFE8F801D79745C4631D09FFF36C82AA37FC4CCE4FC946683D7B336B63032`
- hash analyzer: SHA2-256
- hash type: `-m1400`


## Hash Level 1.4

- hash: `$2y$12$Dwt1BZj6pcyc3Dy1FWZ5ieeUznr71EeNkJkUlypTsgbX1H68wsRom`
- hash analyzer: bcrypt 
- hash type: `-m3200`

The hint suggests using a mask attack, and answer is length of 4, look at hashcat charsets for options (lowercase = l). Having 4 letters in lowercase: `?l?l?l?l`. Using a mask is a brute force attack which is `-a3`.

I tried:

- `hashcat -m3200 -a3 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt ?l?l?l?l`
- `hashcat -a3 -m3200 hashes.txt`
- trying to understand the mask attack syntax: `hashcat -a3 -m3200 -o hashed.txt hashes.txt ?l?l?l?l`
- `hashcat -a3 -m3200 -1 ?l -2 ?l -3 ?l -4 ?l  <hash> -o hashed.txt ?1?1?1?1`

None of these attempts worked at all. Then I got help from the Discord and was pointed to hashes.com which I learned about in the morning of the day I was working on this.

To get the answer, paste the bcrypt hash into : [hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) to decrypt the hash.



## Hash Level 1.5

- hash: `279412f945939ba78ce0758d3fd83daa`
- hash analyzerL md5
- hash type: `-m0`




## Hash Level 2.1

- hash: `F09EDCB1FCEFC6DFB23DC3505A882655FF77375ED8AA2D1C13F640FCCC2D0C85`
- hash analyzer: sha2-256
- hash type: `-m1400`

Paste in hash into [hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) and get the answer.


## Hash Level 2.2

- hash: `1DFECA0C002AE40B8619ECF94819CC1B`
- hash analyzer: md5
- hash type: `-m0`

Open the attackbox, copy the hash and paste into the clipboard on the left side.
Launch the terminal, type `nano hash.txt` copy and paste the hash from the clipboard.
Exit and save. Open a new tab, run the hashcat command for the basic md5sum hash with the output being written to hashed text file `-o hashed.txt` .

- hashcat -m0 -a0 -o hashed.txt hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt . no results.
- hashcat -m10 -a0 -o hashed.txt hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt . 

The 2 attempts on my own did not work, so i looked for a hint.

- hint: NTLM
- hash type: `-m1000`

Run the command but have `-m1000`.
Copy the password from the hashed.txt file into clipboard and paste into answer input.

## Hash Level 2.3

- hash: `$6$aReallyHardSalt$6WKUTqzq.UQQmrm0p/T7MPpMbGNnzXPMAXi4bJMl9be.cfi3/qxIf.hsGpS41BqMhSrHVXgMpdjS6xeKZAs02`

- salt: `aReallyHardSalt`
- hash type: ?

The hash analyzer had no answer for type. So looking at the hashcat reference, it looked like SHA512 + salt = 1710. Using `-m1710` does not work and was getting stuck on which type it was.

Searching for help online, I read _only part_ of [Cyber-99](https://cyber-99.co.uk/mesmerize/thm-crack-the-hash-ctf) walk through to get what proper hash type, which I needed help as I kept looking at other types. I closed the tab and continued on with hashcat attempts. 

- hash type: SHA512crypt 
- reran the hashcat with `-m1800` 
- while hashcat was running, I tried again with hashes.com and got the answer



## Hash Level 2.4

- hash: `e5d8870e5bdd26602cab8dbe07a942c8669e56d6`
- salt: tryhackme
- hash analyzer: sha1 
- hash type: `-m100`

Pasted the hash into hashes.com and got the answer.
