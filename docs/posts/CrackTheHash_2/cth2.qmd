Advanced cracking of hashes and wordlist generation. 

![](hash-2.png)

The link to this room for level 2 Crack the Hash is [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/crackthehashlevel2). 


## Task 2.1

Need to install [Haiti](https://noraj.github.io/haiti/) with the [install guide](https://noraj.github.io/haiti/#/pages/install).

- If on Kali or Parrot, you can just use `sudo gem install haiti-hash`
- then type `haiti -h` for the help page


![haiti --ascii-art command](haiti.png)

`haiti samples ref name`: haiti samples hashcat sha1

## Task 2.2

- hash: `741ebf5166b9ece4cca88a3868c44871e8370707cf19af3ceaa4a6fba006f224ae03f39153492853`
- I tried putting in the 3 types it just printed but did not get the answer, read the documentation and saw the second best program is called Name-That-Hash.

So I also installed [Name-That-Hash](https://github.com/HashPals/Name-That-Hash), seeing that it is recently updated and well liked.

![Name-That-Hash](namehash.png)

- `pip3 install name-that-hash`
- then type: `nth --text '<the hash>' `



Just running the command once, and trying the 1st printed hash type, I got the answer correct.


## Task 2.3 

- hash: `1aec7a56aa08b25b596057e1ccbcb6d768b770eaa0f355ccbd56aee5040e02ee`


When I run the command in Haiti `haiti -e <hash>` I get a long list of what it could be, `SHA-256` all the way to `Umbraco HMAC-SHA1`. I choose to ignore trying all of these.

So I try with Name-That-Hash, and get nicely printed **Most Likely** and **Least Likely** categories of the hash types. One of the most likely is the name for the next question, so far off to a great start.

We get SHA256, KECCAK-256, HAVEL-128 AND Snefru-256 as most likely to the solution. 

- Note: this task does not need an answer


## Task 2.4

Question: _What is Keccak-256 Hashcat code?_

Using the output from Task 2.3 we can answer this question, the answer 
is of length 5, so it requires only values. 

## Task 2.5 

Question: _What is Keccak-256 John the Ripper code?_

Having previous run the hash with the long list of hash types, the `Keccak-256` is near the top, in pink brackets is "JtR:" which holds 
the answer. 



## Task 3.1

For hash cracking you will often need some custom or specialized dictionaries called wordlists. 

- SecLists is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. SecLists is created by OWASP [GitHub link](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

- wordlistctl is a script to fetch, install, update and search wordlist archives from websites offering wordlists with more than 6300 wordlists available. [GitHub link](https://github.com/BlackArch/wordlistctl). If using the AttackBox VM it will have this wordlist (when I opened the AttackBox it did not have it).

  - to install on your VM `git clone <link>`
  - `python3 wordlistctl/wordlistctl -v`
  - The Documentation shows syntax: `wordlistctl {fetch, search, list}`



RockYou is a famous wordlist contains a large set of commonly used password sorted by frequency.
To search for this wordlist with wordlistclt run:

- `python3 wordlistctl/wordlistctl.py search rockyou`



## Task 3.2 

Question: _Which option do you need to add to the previous command to search into local archives instead of remote ones?_

To answer this question you need to go to the GitHub README page, it will show what flag you need to print the local wordlist for rockyou. 
But if you read ahead on the page will see the answer shown.


## Task 3.3

We are instructed to download and install a wordlist

- `wordlistctl fetch -l rockyou`
- no answer needed

## Task 3.4 

You are asked to run the commands again searching for local rockyou file.
When you download a wordlist it is in a `.tar.gz` but running `gunzip` can unzip the file and then you will have `.txt`. The path of where the
file for wordlists is the same, `/usr/share/wordlists/passwords/rockyou.txt`.


## Task 3.5


You can search for a wordlist about a specific subject (eg. facebook) `wordlistctl search facebook` or list all wordlists from a category (eg. fuzzing) `wordlistctl list -g fuzzing`.

- `python3 wordlistctl/wordlistctl list -g usernames` 

I made the mistake of downloading usernames which took a big chunk of my VM disk usage, so be careful with what you run. 


## Task 4.1

The most common hash cracking tools are Hashcat and John the Ripper.

Modes of cracking:

- `wordlist` = a long list of common words like a dictionary for passwords
- `incremental mode` = trying all possible character combinations as passwords (powerful but longer run time, especially if password is long)
- `rule mode` = uses wodlist mode with a character/ string pattern

Rule based bruteforce attacks:

- generating a custom wordlist and using the standard wordlist mode iwth it
- using a common wordlist with a custom rules. _This saves time iterating over thousands of lines of possible passwords_. Using a custom wordlist can be applied for multiple cracking uses.


> I changed the order of instructions from the room as this process makes more sense to install SecList then talk about John the Ripper.



We are instructed to install a [SecList](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists#install) wordlist from GitHub. Then
use the top 10,000 password list.

- if on Kali linux, install `sudo apt -y install seclists`
- the path for passwords: `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt`


John the Ripper has syntax for using a wordlist with rules.

- locate where John the Ripper is on your machine, for me it is `/usr/share/john`
- `sudo touch john-local.conf` 


insert: 
```
[List.Rules:THM01]
$[0-9]$[0-9]
```

- there is a file `john.conf` and need to run this file, `john john.conf`  then quit

Now the hash we need to crack.

- hash: `2d5c517a4f7a14dcb38329d228a7d18a3b78ce83`
- hash type: SHA1

Put the hash into a text file, specify the hash type, the wordlist and our rule name.

- i named my file `riphash.txt`
- `john riphash.txt --format=raw-sha1 --wordlist=/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt --rules=THM01`

Wow, that was _SUPER_ fast to crack such a simple password. 


## Task 5.1

Sometimes making a custom wordlist makes more sense as it 
can be used for multiple tools, but in other cases a wordlist is
the better choice. Wordlists are best suited for passwords you 
know are around a specific topic like dogs, then you would use
a wordlist for dogs.


> this part I skipped installing Mentalist [GitHub link](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist) to generate a wordlist. No answer is required.


## Task 5.2 

- hash: `ed91365105bba79fdab20c376d83d752`
- hash type: md5

I used hashes.com and pasted in the hash instead of messing with the the previous section dog wordlist and mentalist app. It found the answer as it is a md5 hash.

## Task 5.3 

Now we have new tool to use, called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL)  _Custom Word List generator_ that generates a wordlist from a website which is helpful for topic specific passwords. 

- install via `git clone <link>`
- `sudo gem install bundler`, `bundle install` I got a warning 
- changed permissions for `cewl.rb` as shown `chmod u+x ./cewl.rb`
- navigate to cewl/ and run `cewl --h`
- no answer required



## Task 5.4

We are given a website to point teh cewl program to crawl and a depth of 2 links.

- `cewl -d 2 -w $(pwd)/example.txt https://example.org`
- Note that this makes example.txt file in the `pwd` which is where the answer can be found


## Task 5.5 

Another tool to install from GitHub is [TTPassGen](https://github.com/tp7309/TTPassGen) which is a scriptable password dictionary generator.

- (Python 3) `pip install ttpassgen`
- Kali linux has it installed


With TTPassGen we can craft wordlists from scratch. Create a first wordlist containing all 4 digits PIN code value.

- `ttpassgen --rule '[?d]{4:4:*}' pin.txt`
- no answer required

## Task 5.6


Generate a list of all lowercase chars combinations of length 1 to 3.

- `ttpassgen --rule '[?l]{1:3:*}' abc.txt`
- no answer required

## Task 5.7 

Then we can create a new wordlist that is a combination of several wordlists. Eg. combine the PIN wordlist and the letter wordlist separated by a dash.

- Warning: combining wordlists makes huge file sizes. `ttpassgen --dictlist 'pin.txt,abc.txt' --rule '$0[-]{1}$1' combination.tx`
- I did not make this wordlist
- no answer required


## Task 5.8

Crack this md5 hash with combinations.txt.

- hash: `e5b47b7e8df2597077e703c76ee86aee`

I instead used hashes.com and cracked the hash.


## Task 6

You will have to crack several hashes. For each hash you will be given a short scenario that will help you to create a mangling rules, build a wordlist or finding some specialized data you'll need to crack the hash.

The scenarios are located on the website: Password advisor (AttackBox VM), each piece of advice matches one of the following hashes (in the same order).



## Task 6.1

- Advice n°1 
- hash: `b16f211a8ad7f97778e5006c7cecdf31`
- hint: English male name, md5, border mutation, custom rule


I went to hashes.com and pasted it in and got the answer.

### work through

But the hint tells us to use `wordlistctl` dictionary that has names.

- `cd wordlistctl/`
- in another terminal tab, I copied the hash into `name-that-hash`, it says it is md5
- `nano hash.txt` and paste the hash
- `search -l usernames`  shows what usernames you have on your machine

- list usernames `python3 wordlistctl list -g usernames` and find `malenames-usa-top1000`
- warning: this command downloads all usernames files `fetch femalenames-use-top1000 -g usernames -l usernames`. I stopped the download after a few seconds and deleted usernames files I did not want to save space.

So we now have male and female usernames. 

Now we need to make a John the Ripper rule. Need to make a new rule `sudo nano john-local.conf` or `john.conf` and type:

``` 
[List.Rules:CTH01]
[0–9!@\#\$%^&()_+\-={}|\[\]\\;’:,/\<\>?`~*]
```
_This code is from [Phantom-95 walkthrough]()_  and is helpful showing how to add a real custom rule. 




- `john hash.txt --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/usernames/malenames-use-top1000.txt  --rules=CTH01`








## Task 6.2

- Advice n°2 
- hash: `7463fcb720de92803d179e7f83070f97`

- hint: Rockyou, SHA3-512, No mutation



## Task 6.8

- Advice n°8 
-  hash: `9f7376709d3fe09b389a27876834a13c6f275ed9a806d4c8df78f0ce1aad8fb343316133e810096e0999eaf1d2bca37c336e1b7726b213e001333d636e896617`
-  hint: Web scrapping, blake2, Repetition, CeWL



## Task 6.9
