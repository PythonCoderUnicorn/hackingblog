The commands and files to know to use Linux OS.

<img width='800' src="linux-banner.png">


## Linux Fundamentals

The bullet points of Linux that state the essential aspects.


Core Principles

- everything is a file 
- small single purpose programs
- ability to chain programs for complex tasks
- work mainly in shell (the terminal)
- configuration data is stored in a text file


Components 

- bootloader = code the guides the booting process (GRUB bootloader)
- OS kernel = operating system 
- daemons = background services for functionality
- graphic servers = X-server allows graphical programs to run locally  
- window manager = GUI, GNOME, KDE, MATE (desktop enviros) 


Linux architecture

- hardware (RAM, hard drive, CPU)
- kernel 
- shell 
- system utility (OS functionality)

Debian Linux is a kernel which is the parent to many Linux distrobution flavours (other Linux named operating systems) such as Kali Linux and Parrot OS. Debian based kernels use `apt` Advanced Package Tool as the package management system. 

- to install software: `sudo apt <package>`


ROOT

You use root (admin) privileges to manage, control, install, remove, update and other tasks. You use `sudo` as _super user do_ command, enter your password then the root command will be executed. You can just stay logged in as root with `su`, but it is not recommended. 

- non-root user: `$`
- root user: `#`


COMMANDS

Commands to know and use in the terminal. 

- `/` this is the root directory, you can `cd /`
- `cd ~` change directory to the home directory
- `cd Desktop/` move to the desktop directory from the home directory
- `cd ..` move back a directory (anywhere in file system)
- `rm -r test.txt` remove (delete) test.txt file, the `-r` is recursive and is needed for deleting directories
- `cp file1.tx file2.md` copy file1.txt to new file file2.md
- `mv *.txt ../Documents/` move all text file on the desktop directory to the documents directory folder (need the `../` to go back)
- the up arrow key to get previous commands or type `history` to see all the commands you typed
- `Ctrl + l` to clear the terminal, or type clear



HELP

For any command or software help page manual, type `man <command>` such as `man pwd` which will print the manual for what the _present working directory_ does.

- `man curl` get manual on how to use curl
- `man hashcat` get the manual on the hashcat program
- `<software> --help` to get the help documentation
- `hashcat --help` load the documentation for hashcat
- `man find` search for files in a directory hierarchy



SYSTEM INFO

- `whoami` prints who the current username is
- `netstat` prints the network status
- `top` prints a table of processes running
- `hostname` prints the computer's name
- `uname -a` prints out the information about your computer
- `uname -r` prints out the release version of your software



SHELL 

To _shell_ is to use the terminal and sign into another computer.

Syntax is: `ssh <username>@hostname <IP address>`

- example: `ssh example@10.10.10.2`
- then enter your password



FIND 

To find all text files in the home folder.
Search the home directory for file type, all `.txt` files by the root user.

- `find $HOME -type f -name *.txt -user root`


GREP 

Grep is the command to find patterns of text inside a file.

- `grep -r password *` searches every directory for the word password



## Permission Management 

The permissions of files and directories, who can read, write to the file (edit it) and execute the file.

- r = read
- w = write
- x = execute
- the order : `d`(`owner`)-(`group`)-(`other`)
- `u` owner
- `g` Group
- `o` others
- `a` all users
- `d` is a directory
- `.` are hidden files


<img src="directory.png">

Type `ls -la` to see all files and permissions in the `pwd` present working directory.

To modify permissions: `+` , `-` using the letters, you can use numbers when you use the command `chmod`. 

- `chmod 700 cracked.txt` changed the permissions on the the file cracked.txt giving only root user read, write and execute command permissions (the new part).
