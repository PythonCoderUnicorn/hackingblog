## What is OSINT 

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is using information online that is
publically available about a target. This is the first step and typically
takes the longest amount of time. Like in data science, you spend 80% of your time finding, cleaning, organizing, filtering the data before you do any of the fun stuff plotting the data in tables and charts. 


> Take a moment and think of all the websites, apps and services you have signed up for in the last few years, and all the emails that exist. We all have some digital trail left by forgotton services and current ones. 


The goal of OSINT is to search websites, social media, search engines and any public asset that could have the target's information. 




[OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) website that can bring this concept to a visual graph, which lays out the platforms and areas to search for OSINT data on a target.

The graph shows the many websites and apps that are to be searched for Email Address, Social Networks, Instant Messaging and Dating options are selected.


### check yourself 

It is a good idea to see if any of your emails has been compromised. 
The website [HaveIbeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) checks various email services and accounts to see if there has been any compromises with your email. Using this for the first time is a shock, and you will be informed if your email was part of a breach.


- update passwords with STRONG passwords
- use a password manager like BitWarden, etc.
