Welcome to my hacking newb blog! 

This blog is about sharing all of the Cyber Security / Ethical  Hacking 
knowledge I learn with whomever reads this. My goal is to 
make this information accessible, many parts in one. 

Everything is beginner friendly as _I_ am also learning this
huge topic and sharing what I learn. 

Why start a blog? 

To help others learn Cyber Security in an ever Internet of Things world, anything connected to the internet is hackable. 
By learning some cyber security you help protect yourself from
many vulnerabilities. Those who need to know cyber security the most have barriers to accessing this information or have no
idea where to start. 

I am here to help and be part of the Free Open Source Software (FOSS) community.

Why 'hacker newb' ?

Whenever someone is new to a technology stack, they are called or referred to as a "newb" and that is what I am and who my target audience is.
